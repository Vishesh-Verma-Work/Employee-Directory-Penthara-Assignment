# Employee Directory (React + Vite)

This project is a responsive Employee Directory Management System built using React and Vite.  
Developed by **Vishesh Verma**, it provides an intuitive interface to manage employee records, allowing users to add, edit, search, and reset employee data.  
The application stores data locally using the browser's LocalStorage for persistence and offers a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
